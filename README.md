Greetings weary traveler! Hmm... Let's take a look, shall we? You hands are creased,
and hardened by calluses. Your eyes are parched and hair ruffled.
Your need rest traveler. I'd say your back has seen better days.
You say days of hunching over papers, clutching pens and dice have caused your disagreeable state.
Oh, I see, you say the hunch has resulted from lack of self-esteem not your adventures.
Well... I see. Hmmm... Perhaps... Hmm... give me a moment.

Here, perhaps dndsh will help you with your future endeavors. Yes, there's a `help` command
that lists and explains all available commands. 
No, it will not restore your self-esteem--although you can always `mod charisma 20` if you know
what I mean. (Snooty laughter commences).
What's that? You must leave!
Your comrades await for you? Well, good luck sir! And SAFE TRAVELS! MAY
`<enter_deity_here>` BE WITH YOU!
